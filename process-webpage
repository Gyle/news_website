1. Researched into technologies for developing websites. I found a front-end web framework called Semantic UI.

2. Browsed Semantic UI example websites and looked at the documentation to get an idea of how to implement it into my reponsive web page.

3. Did a rough draft with the help of one of the Semantic UI template examples.
  * assets folder: images
  * semantics folder: Semantic UI front-end framework
  * index.html: source code
  * style.css: my styles and template styles
  * template.js: template animation for navbar re-appaearing after passing top section

4. Looked at Semantic UI Grid documentation to workout how to implement the middle section.

5. I had trouble working out how to align the bookmark icon on my top tea news as it is in my design, so I left it as it is.

6. I implemented a grid container for the bottom section using the Semantic UI Grid documentation as a guide.

7. I tried to align the social media icons to the right in my top section; however, it would ruin the responsiveness of the webpage so I did not right align the social media icons.

8. The misaligned icons bothered me too much, so I did heavy reasearch and found this forum post which fixed the alignment and responsiveness of the web page. Link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47124885/right-floated-and-left-floated-elements-go-out-of-container-in-semantic-ui

9. I was having trouble fixing the responsivess of some header text and the top navigation bar despite reading the Semantic UI documentation. Therefore, I just left it as is since the website content is mostly responsive.
